## Respecting the person: How personal is Machine Learning Personalization?
In this short piece, we look at what we call the "humanistic" view of the person, articulated by social psychologists, moral philosophers, and sociologists and contrast this with the machine learning (ML) view of the person.
 We argue that the ML version views a person as a "feature vector"
and explain how this metaphor is problematic in light of the various humanistic views of the person. [Here is a draft version](./assets/GreeneShmueli_Personalization2020.pdf).
With this work we are hoping to broach a wider discussion about what it means to be a person and how machine learning techniques can better align with these views.




## Hidden Inconsistencies Introduced by Predictive Algorithms in Judicial Decision Making
Here we argue that there are many new dangers in moving towards using predictive algorithms in the legal context. Most of the end users of these algorithms may not be aware
of the many tacit assumptions the data scientists who designed these models used. We point out four ways in which these algorithms may introduce inconsistencies into judicial decision-making.

## Doing Data Science in the GDPR Era
If you're more into data privacy and regulation, [here](./assets/GDPR_mba.pdf) 
you can download my MBA thesis which explains the **history** and **law** behind the GDPR and gives practical recommendations for corporate managers and academics on using personal data under the GDPR. For example, maybe you've wondered what's new about the GDPR or how it compares with similar data regulation in the USA or China?

At which stages in the ML pipeline might the GDPR affect data scientists?

What are key concepts and definitions in the GDPR that affect data scientists?

And [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31033336) is our (coauthored with Professor [Galit Shmueli](http://www.galitshmueli.com/)) paper from the journal Big Data, which details how the GDPR may affect the practice of data science.
