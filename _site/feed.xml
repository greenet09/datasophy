&lt;p&gt;In 2018, big data is everywhere. As chronicled in several recently-published books (check out Cathy O’Neil’s “Weapons of Math Destruction,” for example) about the ubiquity of algorithmic decision making in modern society, our countless daily interactions with internet-based products and services are constantly being controlled, shaped, and personalized via faceless  algorithms. Almost everything we do on the internet leaves a potential “digital footprint” that can be traced, analyzed and aggregated together with the footprints of millions of others. With enough of these digital traces, machine learning algorithms can be used to infer, with remarkable accuracy, psychological profiles and personality traits. For behavioral scientists as well as data scientists, this massive amount of human-centered data represents a novel data source for conducting research, filled with potential new insights into human behavior. For businesses, behavioral big data offers managers a chance to make data-driven decisions to influence company policy and strategy where they had previously relied on personal experience, gut-feeling, and anecdote. In short, the use of behavioral big data is firmly entrenched into modern society and is already changing the way we do business and interact with products and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Behavior big data lets advertisers target you better than ever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the areas of marketing and advertising, big data on users allows technology-savvy firms to micro-target audiences with specific products and services. It is no surprise—though it certainly would have been to Mark Zuckerberg in 2004—that the tech giants Google and Facebook have completely disrupted the market research industry and are expected to displace the “old guard” by 2020.  To cope with industry demand for data, a new cottage industry of “data brokers”—companies that act as repositories of consumer demographic and behavioral information with the goal of selling these data to other companies—has cropped up. One of the largest data brokers, Acxiom, reported over $800M in revenues in 2015 and has partnered up with Facebook to provide them with demographic and behavioral data on users in the USA, Germany, France, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In the US, support for regulation actually seems to be decreasing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the ways in which the average citizen’s life has increasingly been affected by these technological developments, relatively little has been done by governments to regulate this new economic environment borne out of the burgeoning “data economy.” In the USA, for example, industries that utilize “sensitive” data on individuals, such as financial institutions and healthcare organizations, or industries that pose risks to individuals, such as the pharmaceutical industry, have federal laws regulating the collection and storage of sensitive data (cf. HIPAA for health care data and the Fair Credit Reporting Act ). Yet similar federal laws regulating Google, Facebook, and Amazon, who also control vast stores of potentially sensitive personal data on their hundreds of millions of users, have never been passed in Congress. Basic methods of data collection, storage, and analysis have mostly been left untouched by regulatory hands, in favor of self-regulation and a complicated web of industry “best practices”. In 2017, for example, Donald Trump signed a bill repealing the Obama-era FCC Privacy Rule, which would have required broadband ISP providers to obtain consent before collecting and using browsing history and app usage, which was previously deemed “sensitive information.”  Some analysts were then left to speculate that the FCC Privacy Rule was repealed in order to allow large ISPs to compete with the data-rich Silicon Valley tech giants in the $83B digital advertising space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why are we here now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is that technological innovation has far outpaced legal, social, and ethical innovation. By the time society has adapted to a new technology, another, newer technology has already superseded it. This process has manifested itself in a common refrain seen in academic papers on big data and the internet of things (IoT) that the time is ripe for society-wide debate on the “future values of living” and that technology corporations should not have first-mover advantage in these important society-wide ethical and legal debates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Europe's response: the GDPR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the first major piece of regulation designed counter this trend is the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is set to go into effect on May 25th, 2018. Legal scholar Tal Z. Zarsky (2017) has written that the GDPR’s impact will be “profound…[and is] perhaps the most comprehensive and forward looking piece of legislation to address the challenges facing data protection in the digital age.”  On the other hand, the major watchdog of academic research, the Institutional Review Board, or IRB (also known as ethics committees or research ethics committees in some countries), has only undergone relatively minor cosmetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Big data and machine learning is ubiquitous In 2018, big data is everywhere.

&lt;p&gt;The question really depends on whether public profile data is considered “observation of public behavior” or if it instead conceived of as a “collection of publicly existing” records or documents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Your Social Media Profile as the &quot;Modern Public Square&quot;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, a Californian court ruled that hiQ, a human resources analytics company, could indeed scrape the public profile information of LinkedIn in order to train its predictive models to sell to corporate clients. In the court’s ruling, social media sites like LinkedIn and Facebook were characterized as the “modern public square” and it was argued that hiQ’s First Amendment right to free speech protection allowed them to scrape the publicly available profile data, even if LinkedIn was a private company.In another recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, Packingham v. North Carolina, the court struck down a state law that attempted to ban convicted sex offenders from accessing social media websites. The judges cited First Amendment grounds for doing so, and wrote that social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter constituted “one of the most important places…for the exchange of views” in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Overall it looks like law in the US and the EU under the GDPR is moving towards the idea that whatever you post on your public social media page is free to be used and analyzed by academics or industry professionals. &amp;lt;/p1.

&lt;p&gt;In their foundational piece on the sociology of data analysis, boyd and Crawford (2012) build on the post-positivist philosophy of French philosopher Bruno Latour, by arguing that “all researchers are interpreters of data” and that the data cleaning process is “inherently subjective.” They quote David Bollier who points out that the process of data cleaning forces analysts to make decisions about what to count, how to count, and perhaps even more importantly, what not to count when building up the data sets used as inputs to predictive models. These decisions are certainly non-trivial, as any professional data scientist can attest to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under boyd and Crawford’s interpretation of BBD, analytical decisions can be seen as reflections of a particular social, political, and economic context, even if shrouded under the “objectivity” of science or mathematics. Further, as Kitchin writes, “making sense of data is always framed” and that even the algorithms used to analyze data are “imbued with particular values and contextualized within a particular scientific approach.” In short, boyd and Crawford and other social scientists believe that BBD analysis cannot be divorced from the biases and limitations of the analyst. Those supportive of boyd &amp;amp; Crawford’s views argue that we rightly ought to be skeptical when presented with analyses whose conclusions run counter to common sense or prevailing theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;The Epistemology of BBD According to Industry&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast to boyd and Crawford’s views, others, more in the camp of industry practitioners of BBD, exalt what Kitchin refers to as “empiricism reborn,” in which mere correlation is both necessary and sufficient and [analysts] no longer have to “make educated guesses and construct hypotheses or models” and test them with data. In the world of industry, particularly marketing and retail, “prediction trumps explanation.” The most prominent of these “new empiricists” is Anderson (of Wired magazine fame) who, in a controversial piece, contends that “with enough data, numbers speak for themselves” and consequently domain knowledge and apriori causal models are “obsolete”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Kitchin observes that this type of attitude is most often found in data scientists who were trained as computer scientists and physicists and are now doing work with a heavy BBD component. Regarding their analysis of social processes within cities, Kitchin comments that they “willingly ignore a couple of centuries of social science scholarship on the topic” and the result is “reductionist, functionalist [and] ignores the effects of culture, politics, policy, governance, and capital.” BJ Strasser suggests that a similar debate is underway in the biological sciences regarding the question of who is the “most legitimate producer of knowledge: the museum collector… or the statistician analyzing the data?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Big Data Hubris&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tension between the more traditional “hard” sciences and the relatively new interdisciplinary domain of data science likely will not be resolved any time soon. On the one hand, traditional fields should be welcoming of these newcomers as they may bring novel methods to previously intractable problems. On the other hand, leaving complicated analysis to people with little domain expertise can easily lead to spurious and inaccurate conclusions reminiscent of what Lazer (2014) calls “big data hubris,” whereby analysts draw faulty inferences based on huge amounts of data that were not properly obtained or measured in the first place. Until universities begin training more data scientists with a background in both social science and machine learning we can expect this divide to persist.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">The Epistemology of Behavioral Big Data (BBD) According to Social Scientists In their foundational piece on the sociology of data analysis, boyd and Crawford (2012) build on the post-positivist philosophy of French philosopher Bruno Latour, by arguing that “all researchers are interpreters of data” and that the data cleaning process is “inherently subjective.” They quote David Bollier who points out that the process of data cleaning forces analysts to make decisions about what to count, how to count, and perhaps even more importantly, what not to count when building up the data sets used as inputs to predictive models.

&lt;p&gt;The Schrems case was the culmination of several other landmark “digital rights” cases that eventually led to the invalidation of Safe Harbor. Some other important cases were “Google Spain” in 2014, and “Digital Rights Ireland.” Both of these previous cases led the way for Schrems and actually deeply influenced the GDPR, particularly the “right to be forgotten.” In 2013, the Austrian citizen Max Schrems made a complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner in which it was claimed that Facebook-Ireland’s transfer of EU citizens’ personal data to the US violated EU law. At the time, these kinds of transfers were legally valid under the Safe Harbor agreement. Essentially, the argument made by Schrems was that in light of Edward Snowden’s leaking of classified US government surveillance programs, “there was no meaningful protection in US law or practice” for personal data transferred to the US because US law enforcement could obtain access to personal data without a court order. Initially, Schrems’ complaint was dismissed and thrown out by the Irish DPA because Schrems could not demonstrate that his personal data were actually affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;try-try-again&quot;&gt;Try, Try Again&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, just one year later, the Irish High Court ruled differently and concluded that Schrems did in fact have legal standing under EU law, due primarily to the Digital Rights Ireland holding which stated that it did not matter if the complainant had been personally affected in order to show that his right to respect for private life (Articles 7 &amp;amp; 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights) had been infringed. The court also expressed concerns about US law enforcement surveillance and the lack of personal data protections in US law. In particular, the court noted that EU data subjects had no effective means of judicial review under Safe Harbor for privacy complaints. Ultimately, the court found that the “adequacy” of the protection given to personal data in the Safe Harbor agreement was not enough and declared it invalid in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Americans Should Know About the Schrems Case The Schrems case was the culmination of several other landmark “digital rights” cases that eventually led to the invalidation of Safe Harbor.

&lt;p&gt;BCRs can be summarized as a voluntary “set of binding rules that can be put in place to allow multinational groups to transfer personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) to affiliates outside the EEA in compliance with national laws implementing the EU Directive” (Allen &amp;amp; Overy 2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-do-they-entail&quot;&gt;What do they entail?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Article 47 (2)(a-n) of the GDPR spells out the specific requirements for a corporation’s binding corporate rules: at the very least they must include complaint procedures, a statement of the privacy principles they follow, auditing and employee training mechanisms, the acceptance of liability for any rule breaches, and an explanation of how data subjects can access the rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;whom-are-the-binding-on&quot;&gt;Whom are the binding on?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BCRs are legally binding on the corporation, the employees of the corporation, data subjects–through the notion of third party beneficiary rights–and any independent contractors the corporation deals with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;can-i-do-whatever-i-want-if-i-have-a-bcr&quot;&gt;Can I do whatever I want if I have a BCR?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that BCRs do not cover international data transfers to firms that are not subsidiaries or contractors, unlike other data transfer agreements such as the APEC Privacy Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;do-bcrs-exist-for-third-party-processors-as-well&quot;&gt;Do BCRs exist for third-party processors as well?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that said, BCRs can also cover third party processors that process personal data on behalf of the data controllers, which allows them to cover the use of cloud transfers across borders (Reding 2011). Such agreements would typically be included in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the controller and processor (Allen &amp;amp; Overy 2017).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it should be emphasized that BCRs do not allow firms carte blanche to collect and process personal data; the existence of BCRs merely allows a corporation to transfer personal data within the corporate network (and to its data processors), to countries in which there may not be adequate personal data protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">What are BCRs?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Three Common GDPR Misconceptions</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/datasophy/2018/06/22/three-common.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Three Common GDPR Misconceptions" /><published>2018-06-22T17:57:36+08:00</published><updated>2018-06-22T17:57:36+08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/datasophy/2018/06/22/three-common</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/datasophy/2018/06/22/three-common.html">&lt;h1&gt;“The GDPR is totally new.”&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The de facto regulation of companies that collect and analyze data in the USA mainly falls under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission in its role as enforcer of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. Under the Act, the FTC was given powers to protect consumers and business against “unfair or deceptive practices in commerce.” Although the FTC has no direct punitive powers, it reserves the right to seek enforcement of the FTC Act by district courts and thereby obtain civil penalties (i.e., fines) for violations that “cause or [are] likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition”. The FTC will first make a determination whether it has “sufficient reason to believe” a firm is acting unfairly or deceptively towards consumers and then, with the assistance of a district court, either file a Civil Investigative Complaint (CID) or a subpoena demanding information from the company regarding the FTC’s inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-weakness-of-the-ftc&quot;&gt;The Weakness of the FTC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the EU’s GDPR, the FTC’s regulatory influence and ability to economically disincentivize bad actors is relatively weak. In 2003, for instance, the major food companies Hershey’s and Mrs. Fields were found to violate the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by obtaining children’s personal information without first requiring parental consent. The companies were fined $85,000 and $100,000, respectively. At that time, these penalties were the largest COPPA civil penalties ever recorded by the FTC. Considering that Hershey’s 2003 sales revenues were $4.17B, this was a a mere drop in the bucket. More recently in 2016, the FTC targeted the Taiwanese company ASUS when it claimed that ASUS used deceptive advertising to describe its routers as safe to hacking, when in fact nearly 13,000 of them had been exploited by hackers. ASUS was forced to pay only $16,000 per violation  and submit to independent security audits every two years for the next 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ftc-is-all-about-being-technology-neutral&quot;&gt;The FTC is all about being “technology neutral”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the FTC’s general approach to personal data regulation is light-touch and focuses on the key ideas of legal certainty, economic incentive, and innovation. The FTC believes industry-self regulation is a laudable goal, but has largely failed in the area of internet technology. Instead, federal regulation is needed, but only at a base level that is “technology neutral” and leaves considerable room for individual industries and firms to best decide on how exactly to comply. Part of the reason in choosing to support basic regulation is that it will provide firms with the “certainty they need to understand their obligations;” additionally, the threat of punishment gives some incentive to meet those legal obligations. And finally, base regulation will give consumers confidence that businesses must respect their privacy, which will spur consumer activity.  In short, the FTC rejects prescriptive regulation and can be viewed as a currently “default hybrid” system of governance with aspirations towards a more robust “baseline hybrid” system. Time will tell whether the FTC’s exhortations will influence Congress enough to pass a baseline federal law regarding personal data protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Personal Data Regulation in the USA: The FTC’s Role The de facto regulation of companies that collect and analyze data in the USA mainly falls under the purview of the Federal Trade Commission in its role as enforcer of the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. Under the Act, the FTC was given powers to protect consumers and business against “unfair or deceptive practices in commerce.” Although the FTC has no direct punitive powers, it reserves the right to seek enforcement of the FTC Act by district courts and thereby obtain civil penalties (i.e., fines) for violations that “cause or [are] likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition”. The FTC will first make a determination whether it has “sufficient reason to believe” a firm is acting unfairly or deceptively towards consumers and then, with the assistance of a district court, either file a Civil Investigative Complaint (CID) or a subpoena demanding information from the company regarding the FTC’s inquiry.</summary></entry></feed>
