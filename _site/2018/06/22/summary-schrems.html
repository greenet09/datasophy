<title>How Schrems led to the Invalidation of Safe Harbor in 2015 | A Philosopher’s Guide to Data Science</title>

<meta name="description" content="Americans Should Know About the Schrems Case The Schrems case was the culmination of several other landmark “digital rights” cases that eventually led to the invalidation of Safe Harbor. Some other important cases were “Google Spain” in 2014, and “Digital Rights Ireland.” Both of these previous cases led the way for Schrems and actually deeply influenced the GDPR, particularly the “right to be forgotten.” In 2013, the Austrian citizen Max Schrems made a complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner in which it was claimed that Facebook-Ireland’s transfer of EU citizens’ personal data to the US violated EU law. At the time, these kinds of transfers were legally valid under the Safe Harbor agreement. Essentially, the argument made by Schrems was that in light of Edward Snowden’s leaking of classified US government surveillance programs, “there was no meaningful protection in US law or practice” for personal data transferred to the US because US law enforcement could obtain access to personal data without a court order. Initially, Schrems’ complaint was dismissed and thrown out by the Irish DPA because Schrems could not demonstrate that his personal data were actually affected." />

<p>The Schrems case was the culmination of several other landmark “digital rights” cases that eventually led to the invalidation of Safe Harbor. Some other important cases were “Google Spain” in 2014, and “Digital Rights Ireland.” Both of these previous cases led the way for Schrems and actually deeply influenced the GDPR, particularly the “right to be forgotten.” In 2013, the Austrian citizen Max Schrems made a complaint to the Irish Data Protection Commissioner in which it was claimed that Facebook-Ireland’s transfer of EU citizens’ personal data to the US violated EU law. At the time, these kinds of transfers were legally valid under the Safe Harbor agreement. Essentially, the argument made by Schrems was that in light of Edward Snowden’s leaking of classified US government surveillance programs, “there was no meaningful protection in US law or practice” for personal data transferred to the US because US law enforcement could obtain access to personal data without a court order. Initially, Schrems’ complaint was dismissed and thrown out by the Irish DPA because Schrems could not demonstrate that his personal data were actually affected.</p>

<h1 id="try-try-again">Try, Try Again</h1>
<p>Yet, just one year later, the Irish High Court ruled differently and concluded that Schrems did in fact have legal standing under EU law, due primarily to the Digital Rights Ireland holding which stated that it did not matter if the complainant had been personally affected in order to show that his right to respect for private life (Articles 7 &amp; 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights) had been infringed. The court also expressed concerns about US law enforcement surveillance and the lack of personal data protections in US law. In particular, the court noted that EU data subjects had no effective means of judicial review under Safe Harbor for privacy complaints. Ultimately, the court found that the “adequacy” of the protection given to personal data in the Safe Harbor agreement was not enough and declared it invalid in 2015.</p>
