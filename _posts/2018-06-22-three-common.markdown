<h1>“The GDPR is totally new.”</h1>

Actually it borrows most of its language from the 1995 Directive, with a few small but important additions and updates.


<h1>“Only firms that process EU citizens’ data will be affected.”</h1>

Actually, your data subjects don’t need to be EU citizens under GDPR to be protected. Anyone residing (even American tourists) in the EU . Or if you offer product or service in EU. Or you collect personal data from data subjects in the EU. 



<h1>“GDPR will destroy my business. I have to get explicit consent now to process personal data.”</h1>
Nope! Consent is just one of several grounds of processing. Actually, since the requirements of explicit consent are so strict, it might be better to use other means. Gradually work your way down from consent to legit interest to statistical research
