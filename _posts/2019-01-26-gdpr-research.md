## Know Whether You're Exempt
Though many of the GDPR’s Articles and Recitals apply to industry-focused personal data processing, there are several exemptions for certain kinds of research. Principal investigators should therefore first determine whether their research project falls under *statistical/scientific/historical/archiving in public interest* purposes, which obviates the research from honoring certain data subject rights. [^1] It should be noted that what counts as scientific research under GDPR is quite broad and includes “*technological development and demonstration, fundamental research, applied research and privately funded research*” (Recital 159). 

## Key Points to Consider 
* For exemptions to apply, publication must be envisaged and the publication must be in the public interest. [^2] Further, all three of the following conditions must be met:
    + Individuals decisions (i.e., predictions) regarding data subjects are not made
    + Processing will not cause substantial damage or distress to data subjects
    + Publication of results will not result in data subject re-identification

	
* If these conditions are met then researchers can also waive the “right to inform” data subjects of the processing activities if providing privacy notices would take “disproportionate effort.” Further, exempted forms of research do not have to adhere to the following two GDPR principles:    
    + Purpose limitation (relevant when doing secondary analysis of clinical trials, for example)
    + Data storage duration limits 

## GDPR Research Requirements 
However, researchers must still adhere to general GDPR accountability requirements that include things like data protection by design and default, third party processing contracts, keeping records of data processing, documenting and reporting of data breaches, and carrying out DPIAs for high risk processing activities. This includes using pseudonymization as the most basic form of data confidentiality and security.

## General Research Guidelines Under GDPR: 
* Just as in academic IRB review, if the research project is likely to result in privacy risks to many subjects, carry out an initial Data Processing Impact Assessment, especially if there are sensitive categories (health or ethnicity, for example)

* If collaborating with industry, typically the processor (the academic group carrying out the research) must agree that no publication will include information that could be used to identify a natural living person

In order to keep research in-line with the major GDPR principles of *data minimization* and *data protection by design and by default*, it is suggested that at the start of research the following questions are decided:

* What will be done with tables with small sample numbers in cells? 
    + Potential strategies include setting a cell count threshold below which cells will be combined (collapsing categories), or replacing small count cells by reporting 0% 

* What about analyses done at a level of detail below what is necessary to achieve the project’s goal? 
    + For example, must city or district level information be reported when only country level is needed?

* Should extreme values and outliers be published? 
    + Should residuals be reported?

[^2]: This is at least the how exempt research in the UK is determined. Each member state may, however, create slightly different rules for exemption.
