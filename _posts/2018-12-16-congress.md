What's Congress Been up to in the past two months?
==================================================

In order to try to quickly answer that question, I scraped the last 250 bills introduced into the House (from October 16th, 2018 until Dec 16th, 2018).

The word cloud on the left is scaled by TF-IDF scores and the one of the right is based on the bigram frequencies. The TF-IDF version should help us identify unique topics for bills: we see things related to cannabis, guns, sinkholes, suicide, bots, superpacs, and toxic Ethylene Oxides (ETOs), which apparently are used for medical sterilization and as agricultural fumigants. ESOPs are Employee Stock Ownership Plans. Hmm. 

When we look at the bigram cloud we see that social security and veterans' affairs-related bills are the most common the past two months. Not surprising.
