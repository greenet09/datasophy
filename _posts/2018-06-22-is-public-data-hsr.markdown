<h1>Not According to Federal IRB Guidelines</h1>
The question really depends on whether public profile data is considered “observation of public behavior” or if it instead conceived of as a “collection of publicly existing” records or documents. 

<h1>Your Social Media Profile as the "Modern Public Square"</h1>
In 2017, a Californian court ruled that hiQ, a human resources analytics company, could indeed scrape the public profile information of LinkedIn in order to train its predictive models to sell to corporate clients. In the court’s ruling, social media sites like LinkedIn and Facebook were characterized as the “modern public square” and it was argued that hiQ’s First Amendment right to free speech protection allowed them to scrape the publicly available profile data, even if LinkedIn was a private company.In another recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, Packingham v. North Carolina, the court struck down a state law that attempted to ban convicted sex offenders from accessing social media websites. The judges cited First Amendment grounds for doing so, and wrote that social media platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter constituted “one of the most important places…for the exchange of views” in society.

Overall it looks like law in the US and the EU under the GDPR is moving towards the idea that whatever you post on your public social media page is free to be used and analyzed by academics or industry professionals. </p1.
