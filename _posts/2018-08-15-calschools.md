California Schools' Math Performance
====================================

We will visualize which high schools have students performing at or above the benchmark set by the state. Keep in mind that some of these high schools are very small (fewer than 50 students taking the test), so take the results with a grain of salt.

The data was from https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/

You can click in the top right corner to toggle between charter and non-charter schools.

With the magnifying glass icon, you should be able to search for your school as well.

In the future, I'll map out California demographic data.

Overall, we see coastal cities with the strongest math results. My old high school, Chaparral, does pretty average with only about 50% of the students meeting the state benchmark.
